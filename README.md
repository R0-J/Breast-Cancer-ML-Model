# Breast-Cancer-ML-Model
Breast Cancer ML Model is a machine learning application designed to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. It utilizes a logistic regression model trained on a dataset containing various features related to breast tumors.

🔍 Project Overview:

🖥️ Front End: A user-friendly web page was created using HTML and Bootstrap, ensuring a smooth experience for the users.

🗄️ Back End: The server-side logic was implemented using Flask, a lightweight web application framework for Python.

📊 Data: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, providing a robust foundation for our model.

💡 Functionality: Users input data into the web application, which then uses the trained machine learning model to classify the tumor.

🌐 Domain: This project falls under the Medical domain, aiming to aid in the early diagnosis of breast cancer.
